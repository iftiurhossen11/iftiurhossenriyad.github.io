# Md Iftiur Hossen Riyad — Portfolio

Static portfolio site for GitHub Pages. The public pages are `index.html`,
`blog.html`, the query-driven `post.html` article page, and the GitHub Pages
`404.html` fallback. Article content is
maintained in `posts-data.js`. Admin tools are deployed separately to Cloudflare
Pages and must be protected by Cloudflare Access.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. In repository **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source
   before pushing the new workflow, so GitHub Pages does not publish the
   `private-admin/` source directory.
2. Push the project to the repository's `main` branch. If using a different
   default branch, update `.github/workflows/deploy-public-site.yml`.
3. Run the **Deploy public portfolio** workflow and check the deployed site.
   It excludes the admin page and tools, newsletter test page, signature
   generator, and DOCX files from the public artifact.
   The public artifact includes `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`; update the
   sitemap and `rss.xml` when adding or removing blog posts.
4. Follow [`cloudflare-admin-setup.md`](cloudflare-admin-setup.md) to deploy
   the separate admin project and require Cloudflare Access.
5. Newsletter signups use the Formspree endpoint
   `https://formspree.io/f/xnpjppdd`.
6. Once signed in to the protected admin project, use its newsletter test tool
   only with an email address you control.
7. Check cookie consent and GA4 events after the public site is deployed.

## Calendly booking

The **Book a Call** section loads its Calendly embed only after a visitor clicks
the explicit load button. A direct scheduling link remains available, along
with a no-JavaScript email fallback. See
[`calendly-setup.md`](calendly-setup.md) and
[`calendly-fix-guide.md`](calendly-fix-guide.md) for event settings and URL
instructions.

`G-82EWL4BGPD` is the GA4 Measurement ID. Analytics is loaded only after a
visitor accepts cookies. The cookie choice and language preference are stored
in browser local storage.

The contact form uses the configured Formspree endpoint in `index.html`.
There is no public `admin.html` page. The actual admin tools are built from
`private-admin/admin.html` and must only be served by the Cloudflare Pages
project protected with Cloudflare Access. Static files cannot enforce
authentication themselves. The admin build omits certificate binaries; the
public site keeps and serves the PDFs and optimized previews from `certs/`.

ThreatGuard, SecureAudit, Buy & Sell Platform, and EduQuiz use cropped 16:9
screenshots from `screenshots/cropped/`. IR Prohori uses four cropped 16:9 screenshots from
`Project SS.docx` and links to its GitHub repository.
Other proposal-based projects use clearly labeled interface mockups from
`screenshots/mockups/`; these illustrate proposed product screens and are not
captures of deployed products.
The MyGenie section uses four application screenshots from `Project SS.docx`
and links to its live website and GitHub repository.
The Resources section links to a bilingual cyber-safety checklist and the
official CISA Secure Our World and Have I Been Pwned websites. Project Areas
describe work shown in the portfolio and are not commercial service claims.
Testimonials are intentionally hidden until genuine recommendations are
provided with permission. The footer's visit and active-tab counts are local to
the current browser; they are not site-wide traffic analytics. GA4 loads only
after a visitor gives consent.
The **Skills in Practice** repository list in `data-projects.js` links to the
public repositories for this portfolio, MyGenie, EduQuiz, ThreatGuard,
SecureAudit, Buy & Sell Platform, IR Prohori, and Ortho Mess Management.
The Certifications section lists certificates with their verification links and
available PDF previews. The Free Resources section also offers the 28 personal
course notes from `Skills Hub/Course Note docx` as `resources/course-notes.zip`.
They are personal study notes, not official course materials; offensive-security
topics should be practiced only in authorized labs.
The career roadmap is an aspirational 2026–2030 plan rather than a promise;
review its dates as study progress and opportunities change. The creative
section describes poetry, travel notes, and historical reading as personal
interests, and links to the blog, where poetry and other writing are listed.
The security lab section lists the operating systems, tools, and project
infrastructure represented in the portfolio, and clarifies that testing is
limited to owned systems, isolated labs, or explicitly authorized programs.
